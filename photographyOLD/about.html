        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
          Photography has been a passion of mine since I was about nine years
          old, walking around behind the official photographer at a family
          friend's wedding with mum's camera. He took the time to mentor me and
          didn't mind that I was getting under his feet. Shortly afterwards, my
          parents bought me my first camera for my 10th birthday off Trade Me.

        <p>
          I am currently studying at university, completing a Bachelor of
          Science, Majoring in Computer Science. I was privileged enough to be
          mentored by a professional photographer, Angie Curtis, of Treasuring
          Hearts Photography. I assisted Angie with her photo shoots on the
          weekends and during school holidays if she needed me, and I gained
          invaluable experience and knowledge.

          I attended the National Scout Photography School, where I was awarded
          the "Most Improved Photographer" for my improvement over the week
          spent with tutors and other photographers. The school taught me that
          there are photo opportunities in everyday things and to take the time
          to see them.
